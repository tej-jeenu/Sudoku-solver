# Sudoku-solver
This is a web app which solves any sudoku puzzle from a book, website, newspaper etc. The aim of this project was to convert a sudoku solving app which I already made in python into a web application.
I did this using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create the front end of the web app and created a python API from the sudoku solving app already created. In this repository I am showing the main files that I
used for this project
